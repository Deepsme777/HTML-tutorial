        <h2><p>Neonatal jaundice is a common condition in newborns where the skin and eyes turn yellow due to elevated bilirubin levels in the blood. Most cases are mild, self-resolving, and not dangerous, but monitoring is important to avoid rare complications.</p></h2>
        <h2><p>Most newborns develop some jaundice, commonly appearing between days 2 and 4 after birth and typically resolving within 2-3 weeks.​
        <h2><p>Frequent feeding helps lower bilirubin levels and speeds recovery.</p></h2>
        <h2><p>Parents should consult healthcare providers if jaundice appears within 24 hours of birth, lasts more than 2-3 weeks, or is accompanied by poor feeding, lethargy, or abnormal urine/stool color.</p></h2>

    <h2><p>Curing neonatal jaundice primarily involves helping the newborn's body reduce excess bilirubin levels until the liver matures enough to process it efficiently. The most common treatment is phototherapy, where the baby is placed under a special blue light that changes the bilirubin into a form the body can eliminate more easily through urine and stool. This procedure is safe and effective for most infants and requires little more than monitoring for hydration and skin health during therapy</p></h2>
